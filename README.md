# Refactorix

Refactorix is a Visual Studio Code extension that brings you automated refactorings for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Our goal is to provide you with easy-to-use refactorings, which usability helps you understand what's going on.

> TK: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Installation

1. Click on the Extensions icon (usually on the left-hand side of your editor).
1. Search for "Refactorix".
1. Find the extension in the list and click the install button.

## Available refactorings

### Rename Symbol

A "Symbol" typically is a variable, or a function name. This refactoring allows you to rename things and make sure all references in your code follow! It's easier and safer to use than a classic "Find and Replace".

## Extension Settings

> TK: Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.
>
> For example:
>
> This extension contributes the following settings:
>
> - `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
> - `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

> TK: Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
